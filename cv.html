            <p>I created a site where one could get workout and dietary information from. It could also be used
                as a source of motivation or inspiration to not give up on the fitness journey. It encompasses

                where I finished as a finalist. We were building the platform that will power remote work in

                online CBT website where secondary school students can come to prepare themselves for real
                world questions. Its uniqueness is its ability to assess your progress overtime in the subjects
